# The Truth Behind Coffee For Each Age Group

### By: Gregory Michaels

#### Abstract:

##### Problem:

When starting this project, I wanted to figure out what metric can I could use to find and correlate patterns for Americans based on different attributes within coffee. This is important because over two-thirds of Americans drink coffee and us as a society need to understand coffee consumption.

##### Approach:

What I decided to do when starting to wrangle my data, of the 4,000 rows and 57 columns I firstly cleaned and removed all missing values. Then I isolated the columns age and whatever other attribute of coffee I would compare it to. For most charts, I created a bar plot to get a general sense of what information the data provided me.

##### Results:

From all of the plots and visualizations I have made, I have come to a finding. The finding is that younger people drink for pleasure while older people drink for purpose. Additionally, younger people are willing to spend more money.

##### Conclusion:

Due to this new knowledge, coffee shops are now able to accurately predict what coffee, all the way down to style, additions, and strength a person may desire based on their age. Also, based on age demographic, coffee shops are able to accurately price their goods.

#### Background:

This data set was taken from the "Great American Coffee Taste Test" in October 2023. It includes a taste test of 4 coffees ranked based on acidity, bitterness, and preference. This data table also includes other information about each individuals preference on metrics about coffee such as strength, style, spending habits, and much more. Additionally, other attributes about each participant is provided, for instance, ethnicity, gender, education level, and age. This data is important because over two-thirds of Americans drink at least on cup of coffee every day. What I have decided to do is look deeper into each metric based on the age ranges given in the data set. The overarching idea I wanted to figure are the trends of American coffee consumption based on attributes in the data given to me.

#### Data Visualizations:

The red line going across the screen is a linear regression model which tried to predict where values should occur. Interestingly, this did not follow my prediction of a line going from the top left to bottom right (This would signify that the extremes do have an influence on specific age ranges).](images/Screenshot%202024-08-02%20133045.png)

#### Conclusions - The Next Step:

After my three weeks of research deeper into the coffee data set, I have realized that there is much more to this information than just a bunch of numbers being analyzed. The final idea I have taken away is that younger people drink for pleasure while older people drink for purpose. Though my data set wasn't perfect due to skewed data towards the age range of 25-34 and also having only 4,000 rows in the data set.

With this new understanding, coffee shops can now accurately predict a person's preferred coffee type, including style, additions, and strength, based on their age. Additionally, they can set precise pricing for their products according to age demographics. Now the next step is to take this data and information into the real world and apply it. Coffee shops now sell better priced coffee and the right type of coffee just based on a persons presumed age.
